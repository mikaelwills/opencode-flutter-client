4. **Start Chatting**: Begin your coding session!

### Server Configuration

The app connects to your local OpenCode server. Make sure:
- OpenCode server is running on your machine
- The server is accessible on the configured IP/port
- Your firewall allows connections to the OpenCode port

## Usage

### Basic Chat
1. Type your coding question or request in the input field
2. Press send or hit Enter
3. Watch as the AI streams its response in real-time
4. Code blocks are automatically syntax-highlighted

- Monitor provider status and performance

## Architecture

This Flutter app uses:
- **BLoC Pattern**: For state management and business logic
- **Go Router**: For declarative navigation
- **HTTP + SSE**: For real-time communication with OpenCode server
- **Provider Pattern**: For dependency injection
- **Shared Preferences**: For persistent settings storage

### Key Components

- `lib/blocs/`: BLoC state management
